# Electrogram

Electrogram is a project aimed at visualizing electric fields generated by various charges in a two-dimensional space. This project allows users to input different electric charges and observe how their distribution affects the resulting electric field. The visualization helps users better understand the concepts of electric fields, charge interactions, and the principles of electromagnetism. With Electrogram, users can explore and analyze electric phenomena visually intuitively, enhancing their comprehension of electrical physics.
